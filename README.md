# Late night coffee and tea search

It is 8 pm and I want to find a coffee or tea house that is open late night within a 5 mile radius of my location. 

## Motivation

I was tired of looking for places to get coffee late at night only when to click on the location to find out that it is now closed.

## Description 

So let's say it is 8pm and you want to find a coffeehouse that is open right now and within a 5 miles radius of your location.  You will simply click on the the "Use My Location" button and it will pull the your location and populate the map for you. 

You could also use it to look ahead, let's say you're going to meet up with a friend in his area and you need to find something not too far from their house, you could use their zip code to plan ahead on what your choices are.
